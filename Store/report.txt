1. The purpose of the pivot is to divide a set of list by two, sort two of the lists and reorganized then into
one sorted list.
We don't really need to choose the middle item as the pivot.
The algorithm would have behaved differently if I had selected the first item as the pivot each time.


2. quick_select([ 2,64,34,62,9,12 ])
quick_select([ 1,23,41,25,38,100 ])
quick_select([ 5,21,32,3,6,0 ])


3. The elapsed time performance of my quick select program when it processes a large data
set for 1M is 3.4817782719999997 seconds.

The elapsed time performance of my sorting median program when it processes the same large data
set for 1M is 5.381917752 seconds.

The elapsed time performance of my quick select program when it processes a large data
set for 1M is 3.6007519670000008 seconds for the second time.

The elapsed time performance of my sorting median program when it processes the same large data
set for 1M is 5.372060694 seconds for the second time.
